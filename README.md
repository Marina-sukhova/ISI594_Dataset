Rent NYC

The StreetEasy Rent Index
The StreetEasy Rent Indices are monthly indices that track changes in rent for all housing types and are currently available from January 2007 in Manhattan, January 2010 in Brooklyn and January 2012 in Queens. Each index uses a repeat-sales method similar that used to calculate the StreetEasy Price Indices. The repeat method evaluates rental price growth based on homes in a given geography that have listed for rent more than once. More details on methodology here.

Rental Inventory
The number of rental listings available on StreetEasy at any point during the month/quarter/year.

Median Asking Rent

Share of Rent Cuts
The share of all active rental listings on StreetEasy that had a reduction in asking rent during that month/quarter/year.
